# 🌧️RainWise (Rooftop Rainwater Harvesting & Artificial Recharge Assessment App)

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **web application** designed to enable **on-spot assessment of Rooftop Rainwater Harvesting (RainWise)** and **Artificial Recharge (AR) potential**.  
The tool empowers individuals and communities to estimate **feasibility, structure size, cost, and water conservation benefits** by simply entering basic details like location, roof area, and available space.  

Developed as part of a **hackathon project**, the app leverages **GIS-based data, rainfall statistics, and groundwater models** to provide practical and personalized solution.

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ Feasibility check for rooftop rainwater harvesting  
- ✅ Suggested type of RTRWH/Artificial Recharge structures  
- ✅ Information on principal aquifer in the area  
- ✅ Depth to groundwater level  
- ✅ Local rainfall data (fetched via APIs)  
- ✅ Runoff generation capacity estimation  
- ✅ Recommended dimensions of recharge pits, trenches, and shafts  
- ✅ Cost estimation & cost-benefit analysis  
- ✅ Multilingual support (regional languages) for accessibility

## 📲 UI Design
The application follows a **clean and user-friendly design** with:  
- 🌍 **Home Page** – Intro + start assessment  
- 📝 **Input Form** – User details, roof area, location, open space  
- 📊 **Results Dashboard** – Feasibility, runoff capacity, water storage  
- 🛠️ **Recommended Structures** – Pits, trenches, shafts with dimensions  
- 💰 **Cost Estimation Page** – Cost-benefit analysis  
- 📜 **Reports Page** – Downloadable summary report  

(See `/designs` folder for sample UI mockups)
